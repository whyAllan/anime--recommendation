            Our ancestors, shortly after discovering fire, built tools to beat
            each other over the head, it served as entertainment for a while,
            happiness were a matter of having a bigger stick than the next guy,
            however with time they started to get bored of it, eventually
            leading to the invention of television and so on. Nowadays, although
            we are still enjoying beating each other over the head, we have
            plenty of things to entertain with, one of these things is Japanese
            animation. I am here today as a fan of anime to share what I believe
            to be a list of must-watch anime, I really hope you enjoy.

                Mima Kirigoe is a J-pop idol who is trying to become an actress.
                As if the disapproval of some of her fan base wasn't enough, she
                discovers a site that is tracking her every movement without her
                consent. This anime is very dark and confusing, but it is worth
                a look.
